/*

* List Interface:
* List interface is the child interface of Collection interface. It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered(Jis order me element insert hota hai usi order me they will display) collection of objects. 
* It can have duplicate values.
* List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.

* To instantiate the List interface, we must use :

List <data-type> list1= new ArrayList();  
List <data-type> list2 = new LinkedList();  
List <data-type> list3 = new Vector();  
List <data-type> list4 = new Stack();
